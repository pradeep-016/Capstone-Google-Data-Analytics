The case study involves a bikeshare company's data of its customer's trip details over a 12 month period (April 2020 - March 2021). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).\n\n#### Scenario\n\nMarketing team needs to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ.\n\n## Objective\n\nHence, my objective for this analysis is to throw some light on how the two types of customers: annual members and casual riders, use Cyclistic bikeshare differently, based on few parameters that can be calculated/ obtained from existing data.\n\n## Data Sources \n\nThe Cyclistic Bikeshare dataset on Kaggle is a collection of data about bike rides taken in Chicago from June 2021 to May 2022. The data was provided by Motivate International Inc., the company that operates the Divvy bike share system in Chicago.\n\nThe dataset contains over 2 million rows and 16 columns of data, including the following:\n\nStart time: The date and time the bike ride started.\nEnd time: The date and time the bike ride ended.\nStart station: The name of the station where the bike ride started.\nEnd station: The name of the station where the bike ride ended.\nBike ID: The unique identifier for the bike that was used for the ride.\nMember type: The type of customer who took the bike ride, either \"member\" or \"casual.\"\nGender: The gender of the customer who took the bike ride, either \"male\" or \"female.\"\nAge: The age of the customer who took the bike ride.\nTrip duration: The length of the bike ride in seconds.\nThe Cyclistic Bikeshare dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about bike share usage in Chicago. The data can be used to answer a variety of questions about bike share ridership, such as:\n\nWhat are the peak hours for bike share usage?\nWhat are the most popular start and end stations?\nHow do member and casual riders use bike share differently?\nWhat are the factors that influence bike share trip duration?\nThe Cyclistic Bikeshare dataset is a great way to get started with data analysis and data science. The data is well-documented and easy to use, and there are many resources available online to help you learn more about the data and how to analyze it.\n\nYou can find it on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share.\n\n## Documentation, Cleaning and Preparation of data for analysis\n\nThe combined size of all the 12 datasets is close to 600 MB. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will be time-consuming and slow compared to SQL or R. I am choosing R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/ visualizations in the same platform. It is also an opportunity for me to learn R better.\n\n#### Load libraries","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(tidyr)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-05T09:11:42.487409Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-05T09:11:42.519658Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-05T09:11:42.714724Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Load datasets ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"apr20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202004-divvy-tripdata/202004-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmay20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202005-divvy-tripdata/202005-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njun20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202006-divvy-tripdata/202006-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njul20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202007-divvy-tripdata/202007-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\naug20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202008-divvy-tripdata/202008-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nsep20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202009-divvy-tripdata/202009-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\noct20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202010-divvy-tripdata/202010-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nnov20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202011-divvy-tripdata/202011-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ndec20 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202012-divvy-tripdata/202012-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njan21 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202101-divvy-tripdata/202101-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nfeb21 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202102-divvy-tripdata/202102-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmar21 <- read_csv(\"../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/202103-divvy-tripdata/202103-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-05T09:11:48.898160Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-05T09:11:48.900003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-05T09:12:19.071402Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check column names of each dataset for consistency","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colnames(apr20)\ncolnames(may20)\ncolnames(jun20)\ncolnames(jul20)\ncolnames(aug20)\ncolnames(sep20)\ncolnames(oct20)\ncolnames(nov20)\ncolnames(dec20)\ncolnames(jan21)\ncolnames(feb21)\ncolnames(mar21)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-05T09:12:57.315305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-05T09:12:57.318196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-05T09:12:57.441885Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data transformation and cleaning\n\nstart_station_id and end_station_id colummns have inconsistent data type in dec20, jan21, feb21 and mar21 datasets.

However, there seems to be a distinct pattern when it comes to casual riders, whose average trip duration swings wildly from as low as ~25 minutes to more than an hour depending on time of the year. It is worth noting unusually long trip durations by casual riders in the month of April.

Member riders make up 59% of total trips contributing to 34% of total trip duration between Apr'20 - Mar'21\n  \n  Usage (based on trip duration) of bikes by casual riders is almost twice that of member riders.\n \n* Casual customers use bikeshare services more during weekends, while members use them consistently over the entire week.\n\n* Average trip duration of casual riders is more than twice that of member rider over any given day of the week cumulatively.\n\n* Casual riders ride longer during first half of the year compared to the second half, while members clock relatively similar average trip duration month over month.\n\n* Casual riders prefer docked bikes the most while classic bikes are popular among members. \n\n\n## Recommendations\n\n* Provide attractive promotions for casual riders on weekdays so that casual members use the bikeshare services ore uniformly across the entire week.\n\n* Offer discounted membership fee for renewals after the first year. It might nudge casual riders to take up membership.\n\n* Offer discounted pricing during non-busy hours so that casual riders might choose to use bikes more often and level out demand over the day.\n\n### Additonal data that could expand scope of analysis\n\n* Occupation of member riders - this data could be used to target non-members who come under similar occupation\n\n* Age and gender profile - Again, this data could be used to study the category of riders who can be targeted for attracting new members.\n\n* Pricing details for members and casual riders - Based on this data, we might be to optimize cost structure for casual riders or provide discounts without affecting the profit margin.\n\n* Address/ neighborhood details of members to investigate if there are any location specific parameters that encourage membership.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\n* [RDocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/)\n* [RStudio](https://community.rstudio.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) community\n\n#### ------End of case study------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
